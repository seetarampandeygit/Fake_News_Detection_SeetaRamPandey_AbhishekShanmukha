# Fake News Detection

## Objective
This project aims to create a fake news detection system by training semantic classifiers using Word2Vec embeddings. The objective is to classify news articles as either fake or true by extracting meaningful patterns from the text and training machine learning models to recognize them.

## The key goals are:

The spread of fake news has become a significant challenge in today’s digital world. With the massive volume of news articles published daily, it’s becoming harder to distinguish between credible and misleading information. This creates a need for systems that can automatically classify news articles as true or fake, helping to reduce misinformation and protect public trust.
We will develop a Semantic Classification model that uses the Word2Vec method to detect recurring patterns and themes in news articles. Using supervised learning models, the goal is to build a system that classifies news articles as either fake or true.
